        <p>In this section i'll be sharing projects in which i've been working / i am currently working on.</p>
        <p>The project list includes content made with Unity, C#, python, PHP and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Generally, i create videogames using Unity engine and C#, maybe one day i'll be using Unreal Engine or Godot engine, as well as Cryengine which seems interesting.</p>
        <p>On the other side, to create software, applications or automated commands, i use C#, python, PowerShell and Batch, in which i don't have much public projects.</p>
        <p>Currently i'm learning as much as i can about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.</p>
        <p>You can contribute to some of them on my <a href="https://github.com/gann4" class="text-url">github page</a>.</p>
